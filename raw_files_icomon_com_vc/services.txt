Caution: 
A service runs in the main thread of its hosting process; 
the service does not create its own thread and does not run in 
a separate process unless you specify otherwise. If your service is going to 
perform any CPU-intensive work or blocking operations, 
such as MP3 playback or networking, you should create a new thread within the 
service to complete that work. By using a separate thread, 
you can reduce the risk of Application Not Responding (ANR) errors
, and the application's main thread can remain dedicated to user interaction with your activities
