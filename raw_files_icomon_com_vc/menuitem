android:showAsAction

ifRoom

Only place this item in the app bar if there is room for it. If there is not room for all the items
marked "ifRoom", the items with the lowest orderInCategory values are displayed as actions,
and the remaining items are displayed in the overflow menu.


withText

Also include the title text (defined by android:title) with the action item.
You can include this value along with one of the others as a flag set, by separating them with a pipe |.

never

Never ever place this item in the app bar. Instead, list the item in the app bar's overflow menu.

always
Always place this item in the app bar. Avoid using this unless it's critical that the item always
appear in the action bar. Setting multiple items to always appear as action
items can result in them overlapping with other UI in the app bar.

collapseActionView

The action view associated with this action item (as declared by android:actionLayout or android:actionViewClass) is collapsible.
Introduced in API Level 14.
